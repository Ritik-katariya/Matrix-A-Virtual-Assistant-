# Matrix-A-Virtual-Assistant-


## **Overview**
This project is a Python-based virtual assistant that responds to real-time voice commands. It can perform tasks like telling the time and date, opening applications, searching the web (via Google and Wikipedia), managing a to-do list, and providing audio responses. The assistant leverages various Python libraries for voice recognition, AI-based interaction, and task execution, creating a hands-free, interactive experience.

## **Features**
- **Time & Date:** Tells the current time and date.
- **Application Control:** Opens applications installed on your system.
- **Web Search:** Performs Google and Wikipedia searches.
- **To-Do List Management:** Adds tasks, lists them, and marks tasks as done.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Processes voice commands and responds instantly.
- **Voice Command & Response:** Operates entirely via voice and gives audio feedback.
